### About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. student at EEE/CS department of the University of Melbourne, advised by Dr. Jingge Zhu, Prof. Jonathan and Prof. Uwe Aickelin. Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degree in EEE at Unversity of Melbourne and Fudan University in 2018 and 2016, repectively. 

My interests mainly focus on machine learning, transfer learning and information theory.
